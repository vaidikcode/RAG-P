Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. NLP combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models to enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data.

Computer Vision is an AI field that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects and then react to what they see.

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. The agent learns through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. Examples include GPT, BERT, and T5, which can perform various language tasks such as translation, summarization, and question answering.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of pre-trained language models with external knowledge retrieval. RAG systems first retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and then use this information to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
